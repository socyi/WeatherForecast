*Log button not fully implemented

*On some devices the form and the map are responsive but some menus are not.

*On my virtual machine I had some problems configuring the database with php, I was getting errors I could not fix. So I used WAMP to do the "POST" part of the project. However I do not know how to send a URL of my localhost, so I will provide the virtual machine link without the POST functionality. The code is still correct though.
